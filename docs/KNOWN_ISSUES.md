### P1 — High Priority

| ID | Description | Root Cause | File | Workaround |
|----|-------------|------------|------|------------|
| P1-1 | 193 stocks have `gptRank=null` | Rerank didn't run today or ran with < 500 stocks | `scripts/rerank-top500.ts` | Run `npm run rerank:top500`; monitor at `/admin/verify` |
| P1-2 | `DailyRecommendation today=0` after 07:00 JST | Cron reliability or GPT rate limit | `scripts/cron-scheduler.ts` | Manual: `npm run rerank:top500` |
| P1-3 | `RealtimeMarket` staleness invisible | No `updatedAt` check in watchlist API | `app/api/watchlist/route.ts` | Users see stale volumeRatio/turnoverRate with no warning |
| P1-4 | LINE monthly quota exceeded | Over 200 push messages/month limit | `lib/line-push.ts` | Wait for quota reset; all LINE sends return 429 |

---

### P2 — Medium Priority

| ID | Description | Root Cause | File |
|----|-------------|------------|------|
| P2-1 | `week52Pct` uses Stock table `high52w/low52w` which may be stale (J-Quants sync lag) | J-Quants `high52w` updated weekly | `app/api/watchlist/route.ts` |
| P2-2 | `getList()` in `record-deployment.ts` splits on comma — values with commas silently break | No escape mechanism for comma in CLI args | `scripts/record-deployment.ts` |
| P2-3 | `DeploymentRow` badge loop uses unsafe `keyof` cast — adding non-string-valued key breaks silently | No TypeScript narrowing to string keys | `app/admin/verify/page.tsx:641` |
| P2-4 | `sendWxWon` doesn't check `winEnabled` or write `notifiedWinAt` | Known design shortcut | `backend/src/routes/auctionBid.ts` |
| P2-5 | `POST /bill/api` unpaid path doesn't sync `OrderBillItem.amountRmb` | Missing updateMany | `backend/src/routes/orders.ts` |

---

### P3 — Low Priority

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| P3-1 | H5 `PackageImages` img src not processed through `proxyImgMedium()` |
| P3-2 | `sendWxEnding` `isDuplicate` counts failed status rows — may block real sends for 5 min |
| P3-3 | `compute-scores` `SystemConfig` query runs inside transaction (TOCTOU) |
| P3-4 | `/admin/verify` "Copy Acceptance Report" uses `BUILD: (local: npm run build)` placeholder — doesn't read actual build status |
| P3-5 | Backtest result count showing 0 — `update-backtest.ts` needs to run after 7d/30d from first DailyRecommendation |

## Recently Fixed (This Session)

| Fixed | Version | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| ✅ | v8.9.1 | `rerank-top500.ts` crash: `timeHorizon: undefined` rejected by Prisma (required String field) |
| ✅ | v8.9.1 | `rerank-top500.ts` crash: `risks[]` array contained nested arrays from malformed GPT response |
| ✅ | v8.9.3 | `MobileDrawer.tsx` missing 系统校验 entry — Sidebar.tsx is `hidden md:flex`, mobile uses Drawer |
| ✅ | v8.9.5 | `week52Pct` unclamped — stale 52W high could yield >100%; fixed with `Math.min(100, Math.max(0, ...))` |
| ✅ | v8.9.5 | `deployments/route.ts` no try/catch on DB calls — added error handling for both GET and POST |
| ✅ | v8.9.5 | `deployments/route.ts` `Invalid Date` from malformed `deployedAt` string swallowed silently — added `isNaN` guard |
